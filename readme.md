# UI5con 2023 - Develop SAP Fiori apps in TypeScript using SAP Fiori tools

This repository contains the [slides](slides.pdf) and final demo result of the [UI5con 2023](https://openui5.org/ui5con/germany2023) session "Develop SAP Fiori apps in TypeScript using SAP Fiori tools". Expect that there are small differences between this repository and the application built in the demo, as this reference was created beforehand.

A longer version of this demo is available in the detailed hands-on session ["Boost Your Productivity In Developing SAPUI5 apps With SAP Fiori Tools"](https://github.com/c-kobo/ui5con2023).

Note that this is only published for you to revisit the technical details of the demo. The existence of this repository does not promise any current or future functionality. While everything worked great in the demo, it might also no longer work -- if you are still interested to fix this, feel free to open an issue and we can investigate this together.

## Setup
- If using a local installation of Visual Studio Code, make sure that you have the [SAP Fiori tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.sap-ux-fiori-tools-extension-pack) installed; this should already be there in the SAP Business Application Studio
- Make sure to have `@sap/cds-dk` installed globally: `npm install -g @sap/cds-dk`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Open this folder in the SAP Business Application Studio or Visual Studio Code and start exploring the project using SAP Fiori tools
